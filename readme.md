- For question 8, use the function `jaro_winkler`. The function is defined in the file `Edistance.py`
- For questions 5 to 10, the function `uniFreq` is needed to calculate the count of unigrams in the corpus $C_3$
- For question 9, the function `bigramFreq` is needed to calculate the count of bigrams in the corpus $C_3$
- For question 10, use the code snippet given in the last cell
